## Description

This is a web application for a pizza company where a user can choose one or more individual toppings (cheese, pepperoni, artichoke, anchovy, etc) and a size to order a pizza and see the final cost.  The app:

* Allows the user to choose toppings and size for the pizza they'd like to order.
* Includes a pizza object constructor with properties for toppings and size.
* Includes a prototype method for the cost of a pizza depending on the selections chosen.

|The program stores the user input as variables (toppings are stored in an array) | N/A | N/A |
